REVERT POINT — Before redesign (cooler / fashion-forward)

To restore the previous design:
  Copy these files over the ones in resources/:
    index.html
    about.html
    ai-breakdown.html
    employer-dashboard.html
    personalized-questions.html

Example (from project root):
  cp resources-backup-revert-point/index.html resources/
  cp resources-backup-revert-point/about.html resources/
  cp resources-backup-revert-point/ai-breakdown.html resources/
  cp resources-backup-revert-point/employer-dashboard.html resources/
  cp resources-backup-revert-point/personalized-questions.html resources/

Or restore all at once:
  cp resources-backup-revert-point/*.html resources/
